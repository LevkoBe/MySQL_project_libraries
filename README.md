# Library Management System Documentation

## Overview

The Library Management System is a comprehensive database solution designed to handle the core operations of a modern library. Built with MySQL, this system manages the complete lifecycle of library resources, from cataloging books to tracking member interactions and loan transactions.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Purpose

This system addresses the fundamental challenge of organizing and tracking library resources at scale. Libraries need to:
- Maintain accurate inventories of books and resources
- Track member registrations and borrowing history
- Monitor loan status and due dates
- Generate insights about library usage patterns
- Ensure data integrity across all operations

### Core Design Philosophy

The system follows relational database principles with:
- **Normalized data structure** to eliminate redundancy
- **Referential integrity** through foreign key constraints  
- **Performance optimization** via strategic indexing
- **Transactional safety** for critical operations
- **Flexible querying** through views and stored procedures

## System Components

### Database Schema (pa1)

The foundation layer consists of core entities and their relationships:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Books Table** | Stores book metadata (title, author, ISBN, publication details) |
| **Members Table** | Manages library member information and registration data |
| **Loans Table** | Tracks borrowing transactions with dates and status |
| **Categories Table** | Organizes books by subject classification |
| **Authors Table** | Maintains author information with biographical data |

**Diagram:**

![ERD](https://github.com/LevkoBe/MySQL_project_libraries/blob/main/pa1/image.png)

**Key Relationships:**
- Books → Authors (many-to-many through junction table)
- Books → Categories (one-to-many)
- Loans → Books (many-to-one)
- Loans → Members (many-to-one)

### Performance Layer (pa2)

Strategic indexing implementation to optimize query performance:

```sql
-- Primary access patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_books_isbn ON books(isbn);
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_member_id ON loans(member_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_due_date ON loans(due_date);
```

**Indexing Strategy:**
- **Primary keys** for unique identification
- **Foreign keys** for join optimization
- **Search fields** (ISBN, member ID) for lookup queries
- **Date fields** for time-based filtering

### Application Interface (pa3)

Python-based CRUD operations providing programmatic access to the database:

**Core Operations:**
- **Create**: Add new books, register members, initiate loans
- **Read**: Search catalog, view member history, check availability
- **Update**: Modify book details, update member information
- **Delete**: Remove outdated records, handle member departures

**Subquery Implementation:**
- Correlated subqueries for complex filtering
- Non-correlated subqueries for lookup operations
- Nested queries for reporting and analytics

### Business Logic Layer (pa4)

Stored procedures encapsulating complex business operations:

| Procedure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **ProcessLoan()** | Handles complete loan workflow with validation |
| **ReturnBook()** | Processes returns with fine calculations |
| **GetMemberHistory()** | Retrieves comprehensive borrowing records |
| **GenerateReports()** | Creates usage statistics and summaries |

**Transaction Management:**
- Atomic operations for critical workflows
- Rollback capabilities for error handling
- Concurrent access control
- Data consistency guarantees

### Reporting Layer (pa5)

Database views providing business intelligence and operational insights:

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **ActiveLoans** | Current borrowings with member details |
| **OverdueBooks** | Items past due date with contact information |
| **PopularBooks** | Most frequently borrowed titles |
| **MemberActivity** | Borrowing patterns and member engagement |
| **InventoryStatus** | Real-time availability and location tracking |

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Request → Application Layer → Business Logic → Database → Response
     ↓              ↓                    ↓            ↓         ↑
  Web/CLI    →   CRUD Operations  →  Procedures  →  Tables  →  Results
```

### Security Measures

- **Input validation** in application layer
- **Parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Transaction isolation** for concurrent operations
- **Audit trails** through logging procedures

### Scalability Considerations

- **Indexed access paths** for large datasets
- **Partitioned tables** by date ranges (future enhancement)
- **Connection pooling** for high-concurrency scenarios
- **Read replicas** capability for reporting queries

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

- MySQL Server 8.0+
- Python 3.8+ (for CRUD application)
- Required Python packages: `mysql-connector-python`

### Installation Steps

1. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE library_management;
   USE library_management;
   ```

2. **Schema Creation**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p library_management < pa1/create_tables.sql
   mysql -u root -p library_management < pa1/dummy_data.sql
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p library_management < pa2/indexes.sql
   ```

4. **Business Logic Deployment**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p library_management < pa4/procedures.sql
   ```

5. **Reporting Layer**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p library_management < pa5/views.sql
   ```

6. **Application Configuration**
   ```bash
   cd pa3
   python crud_application.py
   ```

### Configuration

Update database connection parameters in `crud_application.py`:
```python
config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'database': 'library_management',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password'
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations

**Search for available books:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM AvailableBooks WHERE category = 'Fiction';
```

**Process a new loan:**
```sql
CALL ProcessLoan(member_id, book_id, loan_date, due_date);
```

**Generate overdue report:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM OverdueBooks WHERE days_overdue > 7;
```

### Advanced Queries

**Find most active members:**
```sql
SELECT m.name, COUNT(l.loan_id) as total_loans
FROM members m
JOIN loans l ON m.member_id = l.member_id
GROUP BY m.member_id
ORDER BY total_loans DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Technical Specifications
