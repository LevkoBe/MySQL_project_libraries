## How to Deploy the Project

1. Create a MySQL database instance.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MySQL_project_libraries.git
    ```
    
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd MySQL_project_libraries
    ```
    
4. Run the SQL scripts in the respective **`pa1`**, **`pa2`**, **`pa3`**, **`pa4`**, and **`pa5`** directories to set up the database schema, indexes, procedures, views, and other artifacts.
5. Execute the Python CRUD application script **`crud_application.py`** in **`pa3`** directory to interact with the database.

## **Your Journey Begins Here!**

Here's a brief plan to guide you through launching our Library Management System on your own database:

1. **Setup Your Database**: Start by setting up a MySQL database on your local machine or preferred server. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create tables, indexes, procedures, and views.
2. **Execute SQL Scripts**: Begin with pa1 and execute the SQL scripts provided in **`create_tables.sql`** and **`dummy_data.sql`** to create the tables and insert dummy data into your database.
3. **Optimize Performance**: Move on to pa2 and execute the SQL scripts in **`indexes.sql`** to optimize database performance with indexes.
4. **CRUD Operations**: Explore pa3 and run the Python CRUD application in **`crud_application.py`** to perform CRUD operations on your database, interacting with loans, customers, and more.
5. **Procedures and Transactions**: Next, dive into pa4 and execute the SQL scripts in **`procedures.sql`** to define procedures for managing loan returns, fetching customer data, and handling transactions.
6. **Gain New Perspectives**: Lastly, explore pa5 and execute the SQL scripts in **`views.sql`** to create views that offer unique insights into loaned books, available titles, and more.

## **Ready to Launch?**

Congratulations! You've embarked on an exciting journey to bring our Library Management System to life. By following these steps, you'll have your very own digital library ready to explore and manage. Happy exploring!
